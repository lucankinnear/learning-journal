# Day 2 – First Python Script

Today I:
- Created my first Python script
- Ran Python in Visual Studio Code
- Ran Python from Git Bash
- Learned how to move between folders in the terminal

Commands learned:
- ls
- cd
- python hello.py

Notes:
Running Python from Git Bash is similar to how code runs on cloud servers.
